        Hello, I'm Julia. This is my website to post some stuff. I haven't
        bothered with CSS, yet, which explains the charming design. I'm still
        new to HTML and using this page to learn, so don't expect everything to
        work perfectly.

  <p class="standard-text">Hello, I'm Julia Kraus, an electrical engineer from Karlsruhe. I was born and raised in Bavaria, where I got a Bachelors degree in Mechatronics from the OTH Regensburg in 2020.
    During my studies I became more and more interested in electric drivetrains. That's why I did my Masters degree at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with a focus on electric machines and power electronics.
    I finished my M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 2023. Parallel to this I was part of two Formula Student Teams, where I did a bunch of different things and gained a lot of practical experience. <br>
     I like to reason from first principles, which means to build everything up from laws of physics instead of relying on analogy. Because of this I'm always
    drawn to electronic hardware and very low level coding, which is still closely linked to physical reality. For the same reason I'm usually not that interested in higher level IT. As a compromise I'm building this website mostly
    without relying on libraries, plugins or other modern website tools. Everything here is html, CSS and Javascript written by me. Unfortunately this makes the user experience for you the reader not as perfect as it could be.
    But this is only my hobby and have to find a way of not getting bored by it. <br> <br>
    I tend to not share a lot of personal information online, so here are some Formula Student Statistics about myself:
    <ul>
      <li>Number of active seasons: 5 (2017 to 2021)</li>
      <li>Number of Teams: 2</li>
      <li>Number of cars built during those seasons: 6 (3CV, 2EV, 1DV)</li>
        <li>Number of events as active member: 13 + 2 AlumniCups (FSA17,FSG17,FSS17,FSA18,FSG18,FSS18,FSA19,FSG19,FSS19,FSA21,FSEAST21,FSG21,FSATA21)</li>
        <li>Best overall placement: 3rd place at FS ATA 2021</li>
        <li>2 Engineering design finals + 1 first place</li>
        <li>Participated in every EV discipline except Business plan</li>
        <li>Driving achievements: 1st Place Skidpad at FS Italy 21 (with world record), 1st Place Skidpad AlumniCup 2022, 2nd place Skidpad AlumniCup 2024</li>
        
      
    </ul>
